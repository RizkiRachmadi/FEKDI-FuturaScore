# FEKDI-FuturaScore
Overview: <br />
FuturaScore is an advanced credit scoring model that incorporates future Macro Economic Variables (MEV) to enhance the accuracy and reliability of credit risk assessments. This repository contains notebooks demonstrating the performance of the model with and without MEV, along with a visualization dashboard for interactive data exploration.

Notebooks: <br />
Notebook 1 & 2: <br />
Description: These notebooks show the performance of the credit scoring model without incorporating MEV. <br />
Notebook 3 & 4: <br />
Description: These notebooks show the performance of the credit scoring model with MEV, using the date of the competition as the anchoring date. <br />
Visualization Dashboard: <br />
The interactive dashboard provides insights into the model's performance and can be accessed through this link: [Visualization Dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sandy5872/viz/CreditScoringDashboard/CreditScoringDashboard)<br />
